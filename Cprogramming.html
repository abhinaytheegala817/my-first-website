        <b>1.Low-Level Language (Machine Language):</b>
        <p>Low-Level language is the only language which can be understood by the
            computer. Binary Language is an example of a low-level language. Low-level
            language is also known as Machine Language. The binary language contains
            only two symbols 1 & 0</p>
        <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
        <p>A computer can easily understand the low-level language. Low-level
            language instructions are executed directly without any translation.
            Low-level language instructions require very less time for their
            execution. </p>
        <p></p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
        <p>Low-level language instructions are very
            difficult to use and understand. In low-level language, there is more
            chance for errors and it is very difficult to find errors,
            debug and modify.</p>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <b>2.Middle-Level Language (Assembly Language):</b>
        <p>Middle-level language is e computer language in which the instructions are
            created using symbols such as letters, digits and special
            characters.Assembly language is an example of middle-level language. In
            essembly language, we use predefined words called mnemonics</p>
        <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
        <p> Writing instructions in a middle-level language is easier than writinginstructions in a four-level language.
            Middle-level language is more readable compared to low-level language
            Easy to understand. find errors and modify.</p>
        <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
        <p>Middle-level language is specific to a particular machine architecture,hat means it is machine-dependent.
            Middle-level language needs to be translated intolow-level language.Middle-level language executes slower
            compared to low-level language.
        </p>

        <b>3.High-Level Language:</b>
        <p>A high-level language is a computer language which can be understood by the users.
            The high-level language is very similar to human languages and has a set of grammar rules that are used to
            make instructions more casily.
            Languages like COBOL, FORTRAN. BASIC. C. C++. JAVA. etc.
        </p>
        <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
        <p>Writing instructions in a high-level language is easier. A high-level language is more readable and
            understandable. Easy to understand. create programs. find errors and modify.
        </p>
        <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
        <p>High-level language needs to be translated into low-level language. High-level language executes slower
            compared to middle and low- level languages.</p>
